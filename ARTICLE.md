# Setup a Full-stack JxavaScript App

The intention of this writeup is to provide a guide for setting up a full-stack JavaScript application with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and React. We will be walking through how to set up both the front-end application and a back-end to server data up to the front-end. The data we will be using will be supplied by a postgres database. This article is written with the idea that you have knowledge of JavaScript at the very minimum. All postgres SQL queries will be provided but there are some prerequisites that you will have to have loaded on your machine before we begin.


## Application Features

The application is supper bare bones because the focus is on the setup of the environment and not application features. We are going 


## Prerequisites

The following things will need to be downloaded on to your computer in order to follow along with the setup of this project. Everything is written as though you are setting the application up on a Mac so I apologies to you windows and linux folks out there.

## Setting Up the React App

We are going to us `create-react-app` to bootstrap our front-end application.

1. Open your terminal
1. Navigate to the place you want your project directory to live
1. run: `npx create-react-app my-app-name`
